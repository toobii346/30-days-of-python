## Day 4: String Methods and Comparison Operators

Today I practiced using Python string methods like `.capitalize()`, `.title()`, `.upper()`, `.replace()`, `.find()` and `.strip()`. These methods helped me manipulate strings in different ways. I also learned how to use comparison operators like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, and `>=` to compare values.

I felt more confident working with strings and comparisons in Python. Itâ€™s getting easier to understand how code behaves as I see more examples.
