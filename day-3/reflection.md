Day 3: Operators - 30 Days of Python

Today, I learned about different types of Python operators and how they are used in expressions:

- Arithmetic Operators 
- Comparison Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Logical Operators
- Identity Operators
- Membership Operators

What stood out to me most was the difference between `is` and `==` checks if values are equal, but `is` checks if two variables actually refer to the same object in memory.
